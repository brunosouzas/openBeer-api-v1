# openBeer-api-v1
 
### Service focused on beer information. Our goal is to provide a venue for all things beer-related and provide the tools for you to learn more about beer. This is a place where enthusiasts of all kinds, homebrewers, the average beer drinker and beer industry folks can come together and enjoy the hobby.
### In this release, we are only providing information on beer information but we are working to add new features so that you can add new beers to the catalog, give a note to beer among other things.
### Review one of the twenty thousand more beers in our database. Feel free to give us your feedback. Whatever you do, grab a beer and pull up a spot. We'd like to meet you.
